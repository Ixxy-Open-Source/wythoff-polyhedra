Procedural generation of uniform polyhedra in Unity.

Partly based on https://github.com/kaonasi (which in turn is based on the work of Zvi Harâ€™El: http://www.math.technion.ac.il/S/rl/kaleido/ )

My original inspiration was 3DS Max's Hedra plugin which kept me entertained for quite a while nearly 2 decades ago. :-)



# TODO

1. Draw duals
2. Animation: truncation and stellation? P/Q animation similar to 3DS Max's Hedra?
3. VR controls, repetition, slow-motion generation, more shaders etc etc
