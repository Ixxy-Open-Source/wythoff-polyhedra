Procedural generation of geometric forms in Unity.

You start by choosing a uniform polyhedron: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_polyhedron - these are generated using the Wythoff construction.

You can then stack up Conway Operators on top to create much more complex shapes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_polyhedron_notation

Please get in touch if you're an interested party. I'd love to put a proper open source licence on this)

My original inspiration was 3DS Max's Hedra plugin which kept me entertained for quite a while nearly 2 decades ago. :-)

# TODO

1. Draw duals
2. Animation: truncation and stellation? P/Q animation similar to 3DS Max's Hedra?
3. VR controls, repetition, slow-motion generation, more shaders etc etc
